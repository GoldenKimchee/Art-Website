                This is my art website. This website was made using HTML, CSS, and some CSS grid.
                I've been learning bit by bit over the last few months, and I've even went the 
                extra mile and made it (mostly?) responsive. But I digress, this is an art website,
                so check some of my art out on my <a href="art.html">art page!</a> See ya!
            </p>
        </section>

            <p>
                This page was made as a project for my B IMD 233 class! But you don't
                need to take a class to learn how to make a website like me. Just google it to get started!
